FILE INFORMATION:

Demo2Code Folder: this contains all the necessary files to run the program

file.csv: all the files ending with CSV are the data files that we used to import into our python application

cosineAlgorithm.py: main file where the application is being run

templates folder: this folder contains all the html files to be used by the application.

HOW TO RUN:

To run the program open up the cosineAlgorithm file and just run it. If the flask does not work refer to the first comment on instructions on how to fix it. Once the flask is up and running just go to the template folder and open the index.html in a browser, preferably chrome.

INPUT:
When you start typing a dropdown list of books will populate and you just have to click on  them. At the moment our application only accepts 3 inputs and does not accept any type of input with commas so be sure to pick books that do not have commas in their name.
